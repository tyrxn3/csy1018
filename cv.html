          <h2>Skills</h2>
           <p>â€¢	I am a young man who enjoys working with people and am motivated to learn new things which could be challenging but rewarding. I worked as a crew member at McDonald's in the past so I have some experience in meeting people and fulfilling their demands. I am a hard working and dedicated; I always aim at achieving high standards through passion and commitment. I have good communication skills and I am supportive. I am good at problem solving and have the motivation to work when given tasks. I have always supported junior and new students at school which made me feel good about it. I have the motivation and enthusiasm to learn new things and past experience from a previous job; whereby you deal with customers and their queries, which gave me a positive attitude to look forward to future jobs and apprenticeships.</p>
